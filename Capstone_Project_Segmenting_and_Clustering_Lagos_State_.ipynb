        "I lived in Lagos for four years. I worked with Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc. as a Milling Technologist. At that time, the company is the second largest flour milling company in the world and has more than ten fully automated Buhler mills and a daily capacity of more than 8000tons.\r\n",
        "Lagos, sometimes referred to as Lagos State to distinguish it from Lagos Metropolitan Area, is a state located in southwestern Nigeria. The smallest in area of Nigeria's 36 states, Lagos State is arguably the most economically important state of the country, containing Lagos, the nation's largest urban area. It is a major financial centre and would be the fifth largest economy in Africa, if it were a country.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It has the highest population density of Nigeria's states. The actual population total is disputed between the official Nigerian Census of 2006 and a much higher figure claimed by the Lagos State Government. Lagos State annual GDP is 1 trillion naira.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Lagos State is bounded on the north and east by Ogun State. In the west it shares boundaries with the Republic of Benin. Behind its southern borders lies the Atlantic Ocean. 22% of its 3,577 km2 are lagoons and creeks.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Victoria Island, the financial center of the metropolis, is known for its beach resorts, boutiques and nightlife. To the north, Lagos Island is home to the National Museum Lagos, displaying cultural artifacts and craftworks. Nearby is Freedom Park, once a colonial-era prison, now a major venue for concerts and public events. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos  ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos))<br>\r\n",

        "<br>\r\n",
        "1.3 **Interest**<br>\r\n",
        "Obviously, a contractor looking to open a new Tech-StartUp in Lagos would be very interested in accurate prediction of appropriate location\r\n",
        "for competitive advantage and business values. Also someone who is interested in opening a new restaurant will also be interested."
